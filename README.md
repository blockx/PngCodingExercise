# BotsAndUsCodingExcercise
Coding Excercise set by BotAndUs in November 2021

This was a coding test set by a company I applied to work for.  The test is defined in file "Senior C++ Engineer â€“ Coding Exercise.pdf" and 
my solution can be seen by opening the Visual Studio 2019 solution file "BotsAndUsCodingExcercise.sln" and building it for platform x64.

The file "test.txt" is in the correct place for running the program via the VS debugger but the user can copy the executable to any directory 
containing "test.txt" before running it from the command line, if preferred.
